## Breaking Changes

- Minimum supported `node.js` version is now `v22.0.0` since `20.0.0` is now EOL.
- `enquirer` is now mostly failing on v24 and will only git worse, use the `@listr2/prompt-adapter-enquirer` with caution.

## Features

- Uses `[log-update](https://github.com/sindresorhus/log-update)` `v7+` which changes how it handles the terminal rendering, therefore snapshot tests might look different.
