## Plan

This will be updated with the release of `v9.0.0`. Currently working on the beta release. Stay tuned!

However the main issues on the plate, I may or may not get time to include for this release are as follows.

- [ ] swap with stdout-update and give process output a limit <GithubIssue :issue="720" />
- [ ] task output trimming <GithubIssue :issue="725" />
- [x] return writable from `createWritable` <GithubIssue :issue="723" />
- [ ] migrate repository to `eslint` `v9.0.0`

## Migration

- `createWritable` function in `packages/listr2/src/utils/process-output/writable.ts` now returns the actual `Writable` stream. Prior to this it has been hacked out to simulate `NodeJS.WritableStream`. <GithubIssue :issue="723" />
