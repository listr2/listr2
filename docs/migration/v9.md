## Migration

This will be updated with the release of `v9.0.0`. Currently working on the beta release. Stay tuned!

However the main issues on the plate, I may or may not get time to include for this release are as follows.

- swap with stdout-update and give process output a limit <GithubIssue :issue="720" />
- task output trimming <GithubIssue :issue="725" />
- return writable from `createWritable` <GithubIssue :issue="723" />
- migrate repository to `eslint` `v9.0.0`
